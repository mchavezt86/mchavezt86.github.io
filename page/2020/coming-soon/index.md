I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the [Networked Systems Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/networked-systems) at the [Delft University of Technology (Technische Universiteit Delft, TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl) under the supervision of [Prof. Marco Zúñiga](https://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/marco/).

My research interests include visible light communications (VLC) and positioning (VLP), with an emphasis on passive VLC/VLP using natural sources of light, such as the sun. This includes the use of optical modulators and filters for implementing VLC/VLP systems. I also have a particular interest in the application of optical fibres for passive VLC.

In my free time, I like to learn topics related to data science, machine learning, and web programming. My professional background includes IT and network infrastructures for business, such as banking, consulting, and outsourcing services.
